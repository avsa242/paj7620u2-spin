# paj7620u2-spin 
----------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller driver object for the PAJ7620U2 Gesture Sensor

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 400kHz (P1, P2)
* Recognizes all 9 gestures supported by sensor (Up, Down, Left, Right, Forward, Backward, Clockwise, Counter-clockwise, Wave)

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1 OpenSpin (bytecode): Untested (deprecated)
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (nu-code): FTBFS, tested with 5.9.7-beta~~
* P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build
* Detection reliability of forward and backward gestures requires some "debouncing" - this adds a noticeable delay in detection
